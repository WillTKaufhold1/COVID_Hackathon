# Bulk RNA expression from patient lung biopsies

This dataset includes two surgical biopsies of lung tissue taken from two patients with 
diagnosed COVID-19 infections, and two patients with healthy lungs. All samples were taken
from deceased patients, meaning the two COVID-19 patients died of their infection and the 
two control patients died of unrelated causes that did not affect the lungs. All 4 patients
were males over the age of 60.

There is no associated metadata beyond this information about the patients.
